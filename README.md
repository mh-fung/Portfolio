# Portfolio

Hey! I am Hei. The aim of this project is to create my personal portfolio with HTML and SCSS. The portfolio itself serves as a plaform to showcase my skills, projects and stories as a \_nologist. It is designed to provide an overview of my acquired skills and the value I can bring to potential collaborations.

If you are interested in my stories, feel free to contact me!
